System Architecture
Ingestion

Accept WAV/MP3/FLAC upload (e.g. via REST API, file drop, S3 trigger).

Preprocessing

Normalize sample rate (e.g. 16 kHz mono).

(Optional) Denoise or trim silence.

Transcription

Use a speech‑to‑text model (e.g. OpenAI Whisper, Hugging Face whisper.cpp, or Google Cloud Speech).

Sentiment Analysis

Run the transcribed text through an NLP sentiment‑analysis model (e.g. Hugging Face transformers).

Postprocessing & Storage

Aggregate results (e.g. per call, per speaker).

Store transcripts, sentiment labels + scores in a database or push to dashboards.
